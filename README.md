# Curse-of-the-Chicago-Bears
An on-going project where I tell a story about the Chicago Bears and their inability to have a QB that can reach 4k passing yards. For now, just enjoy this .csv I had to obtain myself from the official NFL website which contains every teams passing offense since 1970.

Edit: Finished.

Join me as I explore the Chicago Bears endless fight with mediocrity at the quarterback position. Here, we explore the Bears' passing stats and compare them to the
average of the eras they played in (i.e. 1970-1979, 1980-1989, etc) and indidual year average. We also go a bit in-depth with the years where the Bears appeared to
have success at passing, only to realize that things don't appear as they seem. Special thanks to the NFL and Pro Football Reference for the data they provide
on their websites.
